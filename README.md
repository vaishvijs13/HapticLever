# HapticLever
The Haptic Lever is a novel 3D pantograph designed to render large-scale surfaces in virtual reality environments by utilizing small-scale haptic proxies. The scaling factor of the pantograph enables a small-scale proxy surface to be multiplied into a large-scale static surface within the virtual environment, providing users with a tactile experience at the interface node of the arm's end effector. Controlled by DC motors, the small-scale proxy surface dynamically adjusts its height and position, allowing for the customization of various surface types in virtual simulations. Integration with Unity-based virtual reality simulations demonstrated that the HapticLever enhances the realism of virtual environments by 55% compared to existing devices. This research project was developed in collaboration with students and professors at the University of Calgary's Human-Computer Interactions Lab.
