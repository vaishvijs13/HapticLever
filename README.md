# HapticLever
- Collaborated with students and professors to conduct research project at the University of Calgary Human-Computer Interactions Lab.
- A novel 3D pantograph that renders large-scale surfaces in virtual reality environments by leveraging small-scale haptic proxies.
- The scaling factor of the pantograph allows a small-scale proxy surface to be multiplied into a large-scale static surface in the virtual environment. This is felt at the arm's end effector (interface node). The small-scale proxy surface is controlled by DC motors to dynamically change in height and position; this can customize the types of large-scale surfaces felt by users in virtual environments.
- Among other things, I developed virtual reality simulations using C# scripts in Unity, utilized Arduino (C++) to program microcontroller boards in the haptic device, worked with computer-aided design (CAD) to construct parts of the device's prototype and final implementation, and conducted a user study.
