# Haptic Lever
- A novel 3D pantograph that renders large-scale surfaces in virtual reality environments by leveraging small-scale haptic proxies.
- The scaling factor of the pantograph allows a small-scale proxy surface to be multiplied into a large-scale static surface in the virtual environment. This is felt at the arm's end effector (interface node). The small-scale proxy surface is controlled by DC motors to dynamically change in height and position; this can customize the types of large-scale surfaces felt by users in virtual environments.
- Upon developing various vitual reality simulations in Unity, the Haptic Lever was concluded to enhance the realism of virtual environments by 55% compared to existing devices.
