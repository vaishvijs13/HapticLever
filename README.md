# HapticLever
Created the HapticLever alongside a master's student working in University of Calgary's Interactions Lab. It allows users to feel large-scale surfaces in virtual reality environments, a limitation in VR that has not been solved as of yet. The project required programming in VR frameworks and arduinos. The code can be provided upon request.
