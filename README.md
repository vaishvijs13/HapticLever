# HapticLever
- Conducted research project along students and professors at the University of Calgary Human-Computer Interactions Lab.
- A novel 3D pantograph that renders large-scale surfaces in virtual reality environments by leveraging small-scale haptic proxies.
- Developed virtual environments using C# scripts in Unity; utilized Arduino (C++) to program microcontroller boards in the haptic device; worked with computer-aided design (CAD) to construct parts of the device's prototype and final implementation.
